# Ash Admin Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan implements Ash Admin for Sertantai following the recommendations from the [Ash Admin Appraisal](./ash_admin_appraisal.md). The implementation is divided into 4 phases with clear testing strategies and success criteria.

## User Role System

The implementation includes a comprehensive role-based access system that aligns with the business model:

### Role Definitions

| Role | Name | Description | Capabilities |
|------|------|-------------|--------------|
| `:guest` | **Visitor** | Unauthenticated users browsing the platform | • Browse legal register records<br>• View public information<br>• Cannot perform applicability screening |
| `:member` | **Basic Member** | Registered users with free account | • Browse legal register records<br>• Basic applicability screening (no AI)<br>• Cannot sync to external tools<br>• Limited organization/location management |
| `:professional` | **Professional** | Paid subscription users | • All Basic Member capabilities<br>• AI-powered applicability screening<br>• Sync to external tools (Airtable, Notion, Zapier)<br>• Full organization/location management<br>• Advanced features and analytics |
| `:admin` | **Administrator** | Internal admin users | • Full system access<br>• User management<br>• System configuration<br>• Billing management<br>• Data administration |
| `:support` | **Support Team** | Customer support staff | • Read access to user data<br>• Limited user assistance<br>• Cannot modify billing/system settings<br>• Audit trail access |

### Role Hierarchy & Permissions

```
Admin > Support > Professional > Member > Guest
```

- **Inheritance**: Higher roles inherit capabilities from lower roles
- **Default Role**: New users start as `:guest`, upgrade to `:member` upon registration
- **Billing Integration**: Role upgrades tied to Stripe subscription status
- **Security**: Role changes audited and require appropriate permissions

## Phase 1: Basic Setup & Foundation
**Timeline: 1-2 days**
**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**

### Objectives
- Install and configure Ash Admin
- Set up basic admin interface for existing resources
- Establish routing and domain configuration

### Key Steps
1. **Dependency Installation**

### Key Steps
1. **User Role System**
   - Add `role` attribute to User resource with enum: `[:guest, :member, :professional, :admin, :support]`
   - Create migration for role field with default `:guest`
   - Implement role-based policies using Ash.Policy.Authorizer
   - Add role validation and constraints

2. **Admin Authorization**
   - Create `require_admin_user` plug (`:admin` and `:support` roles only)
   - Implement Ash.Policy.Authorizer for admin resources
   - Configure resource-level permissions based on role hierarchy
   - Separate admin access from regular user permissions

3. **Role Management**
   - Admin interface for managing user roles
   - Role upgrade/downgrade workflows
   - Business logic for role transitions (guest → member → professional)
   - Role-based resource visibility and field access

4. **Security Policies**
   - Prevent unauthorized role escalation
   - Implement field-level permissions (e.g., support can read but not modify billing)
   - Audit all admin privilege changes
   - Role-based action restrictions

### Testing Strategy
- **Role Tests**: Verify all 5 roles (guest, member, professional, admin, support) have appropriate access
- **Permission Tests**: Test resource-level access controls for each role
- **Business Logic Tests**: Verify role transition workflows (guest→member→professional)
- **Privilege Escalation**: Attempt unauthorized role changes between all role combinations
- **Policy Tests**: Verify Ash policies work correctly for role hierarchy
- **Admin Interface Tests**: Test admin/support access to user management features

### Success Criteria
- [x] Only users with `:admin` and `:support` roles can access admin interface
- [x] Role hierarchy enforced (admin > support > professional > member > guest)
- [x] Business model roles work correctly (member = basic, professional = paid)
- [x] Role changes properly audited with user tracking
- [x] Support role has read access but limited write permissions
- [x] Policies prevent unauthorized role escalation
- [x] Default role assignment works for new users (:guest → :member on registration)

### ✅ **COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY**

**What was implemented:**
- ✅ **User Role System**: Added `:role` enum field with 5 roles (guest, member, professional, admin, support)
- ✅ **Database Migration**: Applied migration with default `:guest` role for all users
- ✅ **Enhanced Authentication**: Updated `require_admin_authentication` plug to check user roles
- ✅ **Ash Policy Authorization**: Configured role-based policies for User, Organization, and SyncConfiguration resources
- ✅ **Role Management Actions**: Added admin-only role update actions and business logic for role transitions
- ✅ **Admin Interface Integration**: Role field automatically available in Ash Admin for user management

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **Role Enum**: `[:guest, :member, :professional, :admin, :support]` with proper constraints
- **Role Hierarchy**: Helper functions in User resource (`lib/sertantai/accounts/user.ex:159-175`)
- **Authentication Enhancement**: Admin access limited to `:admin` and `:support` roles (`lib/sertantai_web/router.ex:61-87`)
- **Ash Policies**: 
  - User resource: Role-based CRUD with self-access and admin override (`lib/sertantai/accounts/user.ex:126-156`)
  - Organization resource: Admin/support read access, admin write access (`lib/sertantai/organizations/organization.ex:252-266`)
  - SyncConfiguration resource: User owns data, admin/support access patterns (`lib/sertantai/sync/sync_configuration.ex:122-149`)
- **SAT Solver**: Added `picosat_elixir` dependency for policy evaluation (`mix.exs:45`)

**Role Business Logic:**
- **Default Assignment**: New users start as `:guest`, become `:member` on registration
- **Subscription Integration**: Ready for `:professional` role upgrade via Stripe (Phase 4)
- **Admin Management**: Admins can modify any user roles, users cannot escalate their own roles
- **Support Access**: Support team has read access to help users, limited write permissions

**Files Modified:**

## Phase 4: Admin Interface Testing & Validation (SUPERSEDED)
**Timeline: 1-2 days**
**Status: ❌ DISABLED DUE TO MEMORY ISSUES**

### Issue Summary
During implementation, we discovered that **AshAdmin has fundamental memory exhaustion issues** that make it unsuitable for production use:

- **OOM Killer Triggered**: Even with minimal data (5 users), AshAdmin triggers the Linux OOM killer
- **Not Data-Specific**: Issue persists even when excluding large datasets (UK LRT records)
- **Memory Introspection**: Phoenix LiveView's resource introspection in AshAdmin appears to have memory leaks
- **Production Risk**: Cannot deploy AshAdmin to production due to server stability concerns

### Alternative Approach
- **Phase 4 Redirected**: Focus shifted to comprehensive role-based authentication testing instead
- **Test Suite Created**: Built robust test coverage for the role system that will support future admin interface alternatives
- **Documentation Updated**: See `/docs/dev/admin_page_error.md` for full investigation details
- **Router Disabled**: AshAdmin routes commented out in router due to memory issues

### Status
- ❌ **AshAdmin interface disabled** due to memory exhaustion
- ✅ **Role system fully tested** and ready for alternative admin solutions
- ✅ **Security policies verified** through comprehensive test suite
- 📋 **Future**: Consider custom admin interface or alternative admin solutions
