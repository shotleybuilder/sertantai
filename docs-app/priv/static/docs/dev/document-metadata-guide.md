# Document Metadata Guide for Creators

This guide explains how to properly structure your documentation with YAML frontmatter metadata to ensure optimal integration with Sertantai's search, filter, and sort features.

## üìã YAML Frontmatter Overview

Every documentation file should begin with YAML frontmatter enclosed in triple dashes:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Document Title"
category: "dev"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
priority: "high"
author: "Your Name"
description: "Brief description of the document"
status: "live"
---
```

## üîë Required Fields

### title
- **Purpose**: Display name in navigation and search results
- **Format**: String in quotes
- **Best Practices**:
  - Keep concise but descriptive (2-8 words)
  - Use title case: "Getting Started with Phoenix"
  - Avoid redundant words like "Documentation" or "Guide" in titles
  - Be specific: "LiveView State Management" vs "State Guide"

```yaml
# ‚úÖ Good
title: "Authentication Setup"
title: "Database Migration Guide" 
title: "API Error Handling"

# ‚ùå Avoid
title: "Documentation for Authentication Setup Guide"
title: "Guide"
title: "How to Do Database Stuff"
```

### category
- **Purpose**: Primary classification for filtering
- **Format**: String (lowercase)
- **Standard Categories**:
  - `"dev"` - Developer documentation, technical guides
  - `"user"` - End-user guides, getting started
  - `"build"` - Build, deployment, infrastructure
  - `"test"` - Testing guides, QA documentation
  - `"api"` - API reference and integration guides

```yaml
# ‚úÖ Examples
category: "dev"      # Technical implementation guide

## üìä Metadata Strategy by Document Type

### Setup/Installation Guides
```yaml
---
title: "Phoenix LiveView Setup"
category: "dev"
tags: ["phoenix", "liveview", "setup", "installation", "beginner"]
priority: "high"
author: "Platform Team"
description: "Complete setup guide for Phoenix LiveView including dependencies and configuration"
status: "live"
---
```

### Feature Documentation

priority: "medium"
author: "Backend Team"
description: "Implementing real-time data synchronization using Phoenix PubSub and LiveView"
---
```

### User Guides
```yaml
---
title: "Dashboard Navigation"
category: "user"
tags: ["dashboard", "navigation", "ui", "beginner"]
priority: "high"

```

## üéØ SEO and Discoverability

### Keyword Optimization
- Include important keywords in `title`, `description`, and `tags`
- Use terms your audience would search for
- Balance specificity with discoverability

### Tag Strategy
```yaml
# ‚úÖ Multi-level tagging strategy
tags: [
  "phoenix",           # Technology
  "authentication",    # Feature
  "oauth",            # Specific implementation
  "setup",            # Task type
  "intermediate"      # Difficulty level
]
```

### Cross-Reference Support
```yaml
# Link related documents
related:
  - "/dev/oauth-configuration"
  - "/dev/session-management"
  - "/user/login-troubleshooting"
```

## üìÅ File Organization Impact

### Directory Structure
Your file location affects automatic categorization:
```
/docs/dev/       -> category: "dev" (if not specified)
/docs/user/      -> category: "user" (if not specified)  
/docs/build/     -> category: "build" (if not specified)
/docs/api/       -> category: "api" (if not specified)
```

### Filename Best Practices
- Use kebab-case: `oauth-setup-guide.md`
- Include key terms: `phoenix-liveview-authentication.md`
- Avoid spaces and special characters

## ‚ö° Performance Considerations

### Efficient Metadata
- Keep tag arrays reasonable (3-7 items)
- Use consistent terminology across documents
- Avoid duplicate information between fields

### Search Optimization
```yaml
# ‚úÖ Search-friendly metadata
title: "Phoenix LiveView Real-time Features"
tags: ["phoenix", "liveview", "real-time", "pubsub", "websockets"]
description: "Building real-time features with Phoenix LiveView and PubSub"

# ‚ùå Poor for search
title: "Guide"
tags: ["guide", "documentation", "help"]
description: "A guide about stuff"
```

## üîÑ Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Review
- **Quarterly**: Review `priority` and `status` fields
- **After major changes**: Update `tags` and `description`
- **Version updates**: Modify related technology tags

### Consistency Checks
- Use consistent author names across documents
- Standardize tag naming conventions
- Regular audit of category distribution

### Deprecation Process
```yaml
# Mark legacy content
status: "archived"
priority: "low"
tags: ["legacy", "deprecated", "v1"]
description: "[DEPRECATED] Legacy authentication system - see v2 guide"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Validation

### Frontmatter Validation
The documentation system validates:
- Required fields presence
- Category values against allowed list
- Tag format and reasonable limits
- Priority values

### Content Guidelines
- **Title**: 2-8 words, descriptive, no redundancy
- **Tags**: 3-7 items, specific and relevant
- **Description**: 50-150 characters, keyword-rich
- **Category**: Must match system categories

## üìö Examples and Templates

### Basic Template
```yaml
---
title: "Document Title Here"
category: "dev"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
priority: "medium"
author: "Your Name"
description: "Brief but descriptive summary of the document content and purpose"
---
```

### Complete Example
