# Custom Admin Interface Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of a custom admin interface for Sertantai to replace the problematic AshAdmin library. The custom solution leverages the existing role-based authentication system and Ash framework capabilities while providing a lightweight, memory-efficient admin interface.

## Background

**Why Custom Admin Interface?**
- ‚ùå **AshAdmin Memory Issues**: AshAdmin triggers Linux OOM killer even with minimal data
- ‚ùå **Production Risk**: Cannot deploy AshAdmin due to server stability concerns
- ‚úÖ **Existing Foundation**: Robust role-based authentication system already implemented and tested
- ‚úÖ **Ash Integration**: Leverage existing Ash resources, policies, and business logic
- ‚úÖ **Performance Control**: Custom interface allows precise memory and performance optimization

## User Role System (Inherited)

The custom admin interface will use the existing 5-tier role system:

| Role | Access Level | Admin Capabilities |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| `:admin` | **Full Access** | ‚Ä¢ User management<br>‚Ä¢ Billing administration<br>‚Ä¢ System configuration<br>‚Ä¢ All CRUD operations |
| `:support` | **Read + Limited Write** | ‚Ä¢ User assistance<br>‚Ä¢ Read access to all data<br>‚Ä¢ Limited user updates<br>‚Ä¢ Cannot modify billing/system settings |
| `:professional` | **No Admin Access** | Blocked from admin interface |
| `:member` | **No Admin Access** | Blocked from admin interface |
| `:guest` | **No Admin Access** | Blocked from admin interface |

## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **Memory Performance**
   - **Risk**: Custom interface could develop similar memory issues as AshAdmin
   - **Mitigation**: Careful pagination, lazy loading, memory profiling throughout development
   - **Monitoring**: Implement memory monitoring and alerts

2. **Development Time**
   - **Risk**: Custom development takes longer than expected
   - **Mitigation**: Phased approach with MVP first, leveraging existing components
   - **Fallback**: Core functionality can be delivered even if advanced features delayed

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - **Risk**: Custom implementation introduces security gaps
   - **Mitigation**: Leverage existing Ash security framework, comprehensive testing
   - **Review**: Security review at each phase completion

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **User Experience**
   - **Risk**: Custom interface less polished than expected
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on core functionality first, polish iteratively
   - **Feedback**: Early user testing with admin team

2. **Maintenance Overhead**
   - **Risk**: Custom solution requires ongoing maintenance
   - **Mitigation**: Use standard Phoenix patterns, comprehensive documentation
   - **Planning**: Factor maintenance into long-term planning
