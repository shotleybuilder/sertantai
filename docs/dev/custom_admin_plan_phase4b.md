```

## Stripe Webhook Integration
- **Payment Success**: Automatic role upgrade to `:professional`
- **Payment Failed**: Grace period, then role downgrade warning
- **Subscription Cancelled**: Role downgrade to `:member`
- **Invoice Created**: Notification and admin visibility
- **Customer Updated**: Sync billing information

## Testing Strategy
- **Stripe Tests**: Test Stripe API integration and webhook handling
- **Billing Tests**: Verify subscription CRUD operations
- **Role Integration Tests**: Test automatic role changes
- **Webhook Tests**: Verify real-time subscription updates
- **Payment Tests**: Test payment failure and recovery flows
- **Security Tests**: Ensure billing data security
