● Ash Admin Evaluation for Sertantai

  Based on my investigation, here are my recommendations for using Ash Admin in your Sertantai application:

  ✅ Strong Recommendation: Implement Ash Admin

  Ash Admin is highly suitable for your use case and should be implemented. Here's why:

  Perfect Fit for Your Needs

  ✅ Schema Management
  - Automatic UI generation for all 14 Ash resources (Users, Organizations, Sync Configs, etc.)
  - Built-in CRUD operations with validation
  - Real-time data browsing and editing
  - Perfect for managing organization profiles, locations, and sync configurations

  ✅ User Management
  - Native integration with your existing Sertantai.Accounts.User resource
  - Role-based access control via Ash.Policy.Authorizer
  - User creation, editing, and account management
  - Integration with your existing AshAuthentication setup

  ✅ Configuration Management
  - Ideal for managing SyncConfiguration records (Airtable, Notion, Zapier integrations)
  - Safe credential management (encrypted fields remain protected)
  - Sync status monitoring and configuration updates

  Technical Advantages

  1. Zero Custom UI Development - Leverages existing Ash resource definitions
  2. Type Safety - Automatic validation using your existing Ash validations
  3. LiveView Integration - Uses Phoenix LiveView (already in your stack)
  4. Minimal Dependencies - Only adds ash_admin to your existing Ash setup

  Implementation Approach

  Phase 1: Basic Setup
  # 1. Add to mix.exs
  {:ash_admin, "~> 0.13.11"}

  # 2. Router configuration
  scope "/admin" do
    pipe_through [:browser, :require_authenticated_user]
    ash_admin "/", domains: [Sertantai.Domain, Sertantai.Organizations, Sertantai.Sync]
  end

  # 3. Domain configuration
  use Ash.Domain, extensions: [AshAdmin.Domain]
  admin do
    show? true
  end

  # 4. Resource configuration (per resource)
  use Ash.Resource, extensions: [AshAdmin.Resource]
  admin do
    actor? true  # For user management
  end

  Phase 2: Security & Authorization
  # Custom authorization for admin access
  def require_admin_user(conn, _opts) do
    case get_current_user(conn) do
      %{role: "admin"} -> conn
      _ -> conn |> put_flash(:error, "Admin access required") |> redirect(to: "/")
    end
  end

  Payment Integration (Stripe)

  ✅ Excellent Integration Potential
  - Use stripity_stripe (mature Elixir Stripe client - 4.9M+ downloads)
  - Create Ash resources for subscriptions, payments, billing
  - Manage customer billing through Ash Admin interface
  - Example resources: Subscription, Payment, BillingPlan

  Pros & Cons

  Pros:
  - ✅ Rapid development (admin interface in hours, not weeks)
  - ✅ Maintains data consistency with your existing validations
  - ✅ Secure by default (no security by obscurity)
  - ✅ Highly customizable while remaining simple
  - ✅ Perfect for internal tools and customer support
  - ✅ Integrates seamlessly with existing authentication

  Cons:
  - ⚠️ Requires careful security configuration (not secured by default)
  - ⚠️ UI customization limited to admin use cases
  - ⚠️ May need Content Security Policy adjustments

  Recommended Next Steps

  1. Immediate: Add ash_admin dependency and basic setup
  2. Week 1: Configure admin routes with authentication
  3. Week 2: Add role-based authorization for admin access
  4. Month 1: Integrate Stripe resources for billing management

  Ash Admin will dramatically reduce your admin development time while providing a robust, type-safe interface for managing your complex multi-domain application.
