## Enhanced User Journey
```
Multi-Provider OAuth Registration -> member (free) -> Stripe Subscription -> professional (paid)
                     â†“                                        â†‘
    Enterprise: OKTA/Azure/LinkedIn OAuth         Data Platform: Airtable OAuth 
    Professional: GitHub OAuth            (immediate sync value + seamless upgrade)
    Consumer: Google OAuth                        Enterprise: OKTA SSO
                     â†“                                        â†‘
    Enhanced user data (company, role, verified email) improves billing success rate
                     â†“
    OKTA enterprise customers = 10x revenue potential (Fortune 500)
```

## Stripe Webhook Integration
- **Payment Success**: Automatic role upgrade to `:professional`
- **Payment Failed**: Grace period, then role downgrade warning
- **Subscription Cancelled**: Role downgrade to `:member`
- **Invoice Created**: Notification and admin visibility
- **Customer Updated**: Sync billing information

## Testing Strategy
- **Stripe Tests**: Test Stripe API integration and webhook handling
- **Billing Tests**: Verify subscription CRUD operations
- **Role Integration Tests**: Test automatic role changes
- **Webhook Tests**: Verify real-time subscription updates
- **Payment Tests**: Test payment failure and recovery flows
- **Security Tests**: Ensure billing data security

## Success Criteria
- [x] Stripe integration working in test and production mode
- [x] Billing dashboard with key metrics visible
- [x] Subscription management (create, modify, cancel) working
- [x] Automatic role upgrades/downgrades functional
- [x] Webhook processing updates roles in real-time
- [x] Financial reporting accurate and useful
- [x] Payment failure handling working
- [x] Billing audit trail comprehensive
- [x] Admin can manage subscriptions and override roles
- [x] Performance acceptable with billing data
- [x] Comprehensive test suite implemented
- [x] Security tests passing
- [x] Role integration tests complete

## ðŸ’° **Business Model Integration**
- **Free Tier**: Multi-provider OAuth registration -> `:member` role (basic features)
- **Paid Tier**: Stripe subscription -> `:professional` role (AI features, sync tools)
- **Enterprise Tier**: OKTA/Azure/LinkedIn OAuth -> enhanced billing profiles -> enterprise features
- **Fortune 500 Target**: OKTA SSO customers -> high-value enterprise contracts (10x revenue)
- **Data Platform Integration**: Airtable OAuth -> immediate sync capability -> higher conversion
- **Admin Management**: Full billing oversight with OAuth provider analytics including OKTA
