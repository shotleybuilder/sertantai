# Navigation Features: Search, Filter & Sort

The Sertantai documentation provides powerful navigation tools to help you quickly find and organize information. This guide covers all the search, filter, and sort features available to you.

## üîç Search Functionality

### Basic Search
The search box at the top of the page allows you to find documents by:
- **Title matching** - Search document titles
- **Content matching** - Find text within documents
- **Tag matching** - Search by document tags
- **Category matching** - Find documents by category

**Example searches:**
- `setup` - Finds documents with "setup" in title or content
- `authentication` - Locates auth-related documents
- `API` - Finds API documentation

### Advanced Search Options
Click the dropdown arrow in the search box to access advanced options:

- **Include Tags** - Search within document tags
- **Include Author** - Search by document author
- **Include Category** - Search within categories

### Search Tips
- **Use quotes** for exact phrases: `"getting started"`
- **Be specific** for better results: `Phoenix LiveView` instead of just `Phoenix`
- **Try synonyms** if you don't find what you're looking for

## üîß Filter Controls

The sidebar provides multiple filtering options to narrow down your view:

### Status Filter
- **All** - Show all documents
- **Live** - Show only published documents
- **Archived** - Show only archived/legacy documents

### Category Filter
Filter by document categories:
- **build** - Build and deployment documentation
- **dev** - Developer guides and technical docs
- **user** - User guides and getting started
- **test** - Testing documentation

### Priority Filter
Filter by document importance:
- **High** - Critical documentation (setup guides, key concepts)
- **Medium** - Important but not critical docs
- **Low** - Reference material and advanced topics

### Author Filter
Filter documents by their creator or maintainer.

### Tags Filter
Select multiple tags to find documents with specific topics:
- Check/uncheck boxes to include/exclude tags
- Multiple tags work as "OR" filters (documents with any selected tag)

### Reset Filters
Click **Reset Filters** to clear all active filters and return to the full document list.

## üìä Sort Options

Control how documents are ordered in the navigation:

### Sort By Options
- **Priority** - Order by importance (High ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Low)
- **Title** - Alphabetical by document title
- **Date Modified** - Most recently updated first
- **Category** - Group by category type

### Sort Direction
Click the arrow button to toggle:
- **‚Üë Ascending** - A to Z, oldest to newest, low to high priority
- **‚Üì Descending** - Z to A, newest to oldest, high to low priority

## üéØ Using Features Together

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### No Results Found
